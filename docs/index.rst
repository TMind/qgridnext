Qgrid is a Jupyter widget that utilizes `SlickGrid <https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid>`_ to render pandas DataFrames within JupyterLab/Notebook. This allows you to explore your DataFrames with intuitive scrolling, sorting, and filtering controls, as well as edit your DataFrames by double clicking cells. Initially developed by Quantopian, `its repo <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid>`_ ceased maintenance in 2020. QgridNext aims to continue maintaining and improving it for future Jupyter versions.
